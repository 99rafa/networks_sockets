## About

Project developed in c.

## Prerequisites

``gcc`` required


## How to run

Go to the "MainProgram/" directory and run:

```bash
> make
```

Two files will be created: **FS** and **user**. Just run each on a different terminal session with:

```bash
> ./FS
```

```bash
> ./user
```
To know the instructions use the command

```bash
> ?
```

Depending on where you run the server, a new directory will be created called **Topics** and a new file called **topicList.txt**, if rerunning the server on a new place make sure there are no such folders or file beforehand, these are vital to the state of the server.

Similarly, when running the client on a *question_get* a new directory will be created called **TopicsReceived**, there all the files regarding questions you fetched from the server wil be saved.
